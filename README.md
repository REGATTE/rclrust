# RCLRUST - RUST client for ROS2

This project is aimed to build a minimal RUST Client to aid dev write ROS2 applications in RUST, and is identified by the client library **`rclrust`**. The client library with all other ROS developments are updating rapidly, and stability is not gauranteed. 

This is a developmental repo, with an `MIT License` WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

Based on [RCL](https://github.com/ros2/rcl)

Built for **FOXY** & **HUMBLE**.

For anyone going through the code and looking for `main.rs`, there is no `main.rs` anywhere as the whole repository acts as a module for your main project, and not as a standalone project.
